# 42 Libft

Welcome to my 42 Libft project. 

This project contains standard C library functions written from scratch. It also includes some non Libc functions which are used frequently. The project contains bonus functions based on singly linked list where we create new list, add to front, add to back, clear and many other operations on linked list.
